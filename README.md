# Advance AI Projects


Codex is an app that is downloaded from the web made by OpenAI. It is a common tool for vibe coding. 
Vibe Coding is a coding method. It means to generate code with the usage of ai. The user tells the ai what they want to create and the agent meaning the ai writes it in the prefered code language. 

Vibe Codings use is increasing rapidly because of how much it accelerates the development of programming projects. Althought it is very efficent it also creates problems like severely increasing the length of the debugging process and decreases the programs security. 

A way of avoiding these disadvantages are checking every code the agent generated to fix its bugs and instead of giving the agent full ownership on the project, it should just be a tool to help the user which means the user will still be the one in charge.

Basically instead of just vibe coding the user is being assisted by the agent and keeps full ownership of the project, making vibe coding a lot more effective while also removing it's disadvantages.

1) I opened the codex's official site from my web browser.
2) I went to the download page, found mac compatible version since i am working from a mac and pressed download to start the downloading process.
3) After downloading the file I opened it with finder. Clicking on the file created a new tab which wanted me to drag the codex icon to the folder called applications in order to add it to my applications. I did that and it added the app to my computer.

5) I opened codex and started setting it up by
- Logging in with my google account.
- Giving the required permissions to the app (Viewing, modifying the files on my computer and etc).

6) I opened a new folder on my desktop and named it "Triangle App".
7) This folder will be used later to store everthing that I create with codex using agents for this project.
8) I went back to the codex tab and clicked on the button called "New Thread" which is on the top left corner of the screen. This button opens a new project, now the input and the output area for telling the selected ai agent what to create and to get the creation are visible.
9) On the bottom of the screen I had the option to select an agent which I picked "GPT-5.3-Codex" for and also I had the option to select reasoning mode which I picked "Extra High" for.

Although the generation process takes longer as AI agent versions or strength of reasoning increase the quality of the generated product improves accordingly and thats why I selected the highest versions.

10) After that I started giving inputs of what I want the agent to create which is the triangle app. After every input codex either asked me a question to clearify what I want it to do or it gave me an output which also made me able to give another input for if I wanted to make changes at the output.

12) The prompts I gave to the agent were:

    - I need to design an app this is the assignment “Üçgenlerle alakalı soruları çözebilen app. Üçgen çiz ,you draw by hand, 10 örnek hepsini çözsün. “ but I was also       told that I should vibe code and shouldn’t give ai full control should tell ai what to do with weird selections or smh
    - The user should be also able to create by angles and exterior angles should be also included so now what does the app do?
    - It shouldn’t let the user write 10 problems for angles it should be able to answer problems when a triangle is drawn by calculating its angles or it should be          able to answer problems that are entered with angles. The teacher told us that he would test it 10 times to check if its works so instead of asking for 10 input        in order to get questions it should just be able to get input
    - For each problem that could be given the user can draw the triangle or give angles
    - For each problem that could be given the user can draw the triangle or give angles of it. The app should be able to calculate the other angles from either the          drawing or the given ones. If it mathematically cant be done it should say bad value
    - While drawing. I agreed on 3 points but also while picking the points on the canvas the user should be able to view the triangle lines that forms if the dot is         placed there
    - It should basically be able to give these values, side lengths, interior angles and exterior angles if it can by the values given by the user meaning either a          drawing or any of the angles that the user gives.
    - If a value cant be calculated from the given input of the user (example: 2 interior angles or 3 exterior angles or 1 interior 2 exterior angle etcetera) the list       for the stuff I wanted you to find should still be there and until it can be calculated like the user added another angle or smh it should stay as N.A.
    - For the first question ı want you to do it immediately and for the second question ur asking I want you to require the user to give 1 side length if the user           isn’t drawing if the user if drawing you should auto calculate the length
    - Also when the user holds their mouse on top of the N.A. text it should show what the reason behind it is like for an example it could be angles not summing up to       180 or lengths not working good
    - Ok create it
    - Built it now on desktop named as a “triangle design fabrication” file
    - I want you to show the last triangle the user gave input for and its values the ones ı listed to be shown scaled down as a history area and it should change            every new input and it should be seen at the same time with the new input but a lot smaller since its history and if its clicked on it should give the same             inputs for the normal screen and for the history screen it should show n.a.
    - If history part should be a small part on bottom right of the screen showing the last input and its values if its clicked on it should consider the history as          the current input and show it on the normal page. when its clicked on the history part on bottom right should show n.a. even if its angles or drawing it should         draw a triangle with the angles input so it always shows a triangle. and the history should update when user gives an new input.
    - When the app is first opened the history part should be empty
    - Every triangles lines should be red and the background should be black. Angles showing on drawing should be white
    - Can ı see prototype ?
    - Alright  bro generate it on my desktop sdai folder and inside it triangle app folder
    - Confirm
    - “Switch to implementation and create /Users/dodo./Desktop/sdai/triangle app.”
    - I want you to create it on here (image of the folder)
    - I want you to create it in the folder named Triangle App inside the folder syai
    - Confirm
    - I give permission. build it

13) I apparently didn't enable all of the permissions codex required to modify a folder and this is the reason of the last 7 inputs. After enabling the permissions from settings and sending one last input to the agent, the agent added the files it generated to the folder "Triangle App".



Summary:
I had a lot of fun while doing this project and I learned:
- What vibe coding is.
- How to vibe code.
- What codex is.
- What AI agents are.
- How to create a web app.
- How to properly use AI.
- How to set up a proper github page
- How to add pictures to documentations on github

Also my documentation skills got massively improved alongside my knowledge and experience at properly using AI for coding different programs.

Here are the screenshots of the website for solving triangle problems that I created using vibe coding method:
