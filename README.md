# Advance AI Projects


Codex is an app that is downloaded from the web made by OpenAI. It is a common tool for vibe coding. 
Vibe Coding is a coding method. It means to generate code with the usage of ai. The user tells the ai what they want to create and the agent meaning the ai writes it in the prefered code language. 

Vibe Codings use is increasing rapidly because of how much it accelerates the development of programming projects. Althought it is very efficent it also creates problems like severely increasing the length of the debugging process and decreases the programs security. 

A way of avoiding these disadvantages are checking every code the agent generated to fix its bugs and instead of giving the agent full ownership on the project, it should just be a tool to help the user which means the user will still be the one in charge.

Basically instead of just vibe coding the user is being assisted by the agent and keeps full ownership of the project, making vibe coding a lot more effective while also removing it's disadvantages.

1) I opened the codex's official site from my web browser.
2) I went to the download page, found mac compatible version since i am working from a mac and pressed download to start the downloading process.
3) After downloading the file I opened it with finder. Clicking on the file created a new tab which wanted me to drag the codex icon to the folder called applications in order to add it to my applications. I did that and it added the app to my computer.

5) I opened codex and started setting it up by
- Logging in with my google account.
- Giving the required permissions to the app (Viewing, modifying the files on my computer and etc).

6) I opened a new folder on my desktop and named it "Triangle App".
7) This folder will be used later to store everthing that I create with codex using agents for this project.
8) I went back to the codex tab and clicked on the button called "New Thread" which is on the top left corner of the screen. This button opens a new project, now the input and the output area for telling the selected ai agent what to create and to get the creation are visible.
9) On the bottom of the screen I had the option to select an agent which I picked "GPT-5.3-Codex" for and also I had the option to select reasoning mode which I picked "Extra High" for.

Although the generation process takes longer as AI agent versions or strength of reasoning increase the quality of the generated product improves accordingly and thats why I selected the highest versions.

10) After that I started giving inputs of what I want the agent to create which is the triangle app. After every input codex either asked me a question to clearify what I want it to do or it gave me an output which also made me able to give another input for if I wanted to make changes at the output.
